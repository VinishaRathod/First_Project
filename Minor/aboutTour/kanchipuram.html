    <h3 class="a">Kanchipuram is a Tamil word formed by combining two words "Kanchi" and "-puram" meaning "Brahma" and "residential place" respectively and located on the banks of the Vegavathy and Palar river. Kanchipuram has been ruled by the Pallavas, the Medieval Cholas,[3] the Later Cholas, the Later Pandyas, the Vijayanagara Empire, the Carnatic kingdom,</h3>

        In Vaishnavism Hindu theology, Kanchipuram is one of the seven Tirtha (pilgrimage) sites, for spiritual release.[7] The city houses Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Ekambareswarar Temple, Kamakshi Amman Temple, and Kumarakottam Temple which are some of major Hindu temples in the state. Of the 108 holy temples of the Hindu god Vishnu, 15 are located in Kanchipuram.[8]

        The city is important to both Shaivism and Sri Vaishnavism. The city is well known for its hand woven silk sarees and most of the city's workforce is involved in the weaving industry.[9]
        
        Kanchipuram is administered by a Special grade municipality constituted in 1947. It is the headquarters of the Kanchi matha, a Hindu monastic institution believed to have been founded by the Hindu saint and commentator Adi Sankaracharya, and was the capital city of the Pallava Kingdom between the 4th and 9th centuries.

        Kanchipuram was known in early Tamil literature as Kanchi or Kachipedu.[10] In Tamil the word split into two: ka and anchi. Ka means Brahma &anchi means worship, showing that Kanchi stands for the place where Lord Varadharaja Perumal Temple was worshipped by Lord Brahma. In Sanskrit the term Kanci means girdle and explanation is given that the city is like a girdle to the earth.[11] The earliest Sanskrit inscriptions from the Gupta period (325–185 BCE) denote the city as Kanchipuram, where King Visnugopa was defeated by Samudragupta.[12] Patanjali (150 BCE or 2nd century BCE) refers to the city in his Mahabhasya as Kanchipuraka.[12] The city was referred to by various names like Kanchi, Kanchipedu and " kanchipuram".[10][12] The Pallava inscriptions from (250–355) and the inscriptions of the Chalukya dynasty refer the city as Kanchipura.[12] Jaina Kanchi refers to the area around Tiruparutti Kundram.[12] During the British rule, the city was known as Conjeevaram[1] and later as Kanchipuram. The municipal administration was renamed Kancheepuram, while the district and city retains the name Kanchipuram.
