    <h3 class="a"> Badrinath is a part of the Chaar Dhaam pilgrimage, which most Hindus believe they should do in a lifetime to gain salvation. The Chaar Dhaam pilgrimage involves visiting Badrinath, Rameshwaram, Dwarka and Puri. Badrinath is located in Uttarakhand and is considered the most important of the 4 dhaams. It is famous for the Badrinath Temple, which is visited by thousands of devotees every year.

        India is a land of spirituality. Hence, there are a number of temples, gurudwaras, mosques, churches, etc. here. These are just a few pilgrimage destinations in India.</h3>

      The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the First World War, the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple's staff, but the site drew thousands each year and up to 50,000 on its duodecennial festivals (every twelve years).[8] In recent years its popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006 season,[9] compared to 90,676 in 1961.[10] The temple in Badrinath is also a sacred pilgrimage site for Vaishnavites. Badrinath is also gateway to several mountaineering expeditions headed to mountains like Nilkantha.[7]

      According to mythics, Badrinath oftenly called as Badri Vishal, was re-established by Adi Shri Shankaracharaya to revieve the lost prestige of Hinduism and to unite nation in one bond. Badrinath is one land richly infused with sacred accounts from numerous ancient Hindu scriptures. Be it the puranic story of the Pandav brothers, along with Draupadi, going past on their last pilgrimage by ascending the slopes of a peak near Badrinath called Swargarohini or the ‘Ascent to Heaven’ or the visit by Lord Krishna and other great sages, these are just some of the many tales which we associate with this holy tirtha.

According to Vamana Purana, the sages Nara and Narayana (fifth avatar of Lord Vishnu) perform Penances here.


This place is considered holy in Jainism as well. In Jainism, Himalaya is also called Ashtapad because of its eight different mountain range Gaurishankar, Kailash, Badrinath, Nanda, Drongiri, Nara-Narayana and Trishuli. Rishabhanatha attained Nirvana on Mount Kailash situated in the Himalayan range and according to Jain faith (Nirvankand), from Badrinath numerous jain Muni got Moksha by doing Tapsya. According to Shrimadbhagwat, at this place Rishabhdev's father Nabhirai and mother Marudevi had done hard Tapa after Rishabhdev's Rajyabhishek and taken Samadhi. Even today footprint of Nabhirai at Neelkanth mountain attracts everybody towards him
